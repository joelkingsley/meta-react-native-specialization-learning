## 🚀 Projects

### 1. React Calculator App (`react-basics/reactlab/`)

A fully functional calculator built with React that demonstrates core React concepts.

**🧮 Features:**
- Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Running total display
- Input and result reset functionality
- Clean, responsive interface

**🛠️ Technologies:**
- React 18.2.0
- React Hooks (useState, useRef)
- Create React App
- CSS for styling

**📖 Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Functional components and React hooks
